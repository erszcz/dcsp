Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem Simulation
======================================================
This is a simulation of the asynchronous backtracking algorithm for
solving distributed constraint satisfaction problems in a multi-agent
environment.

Due to the nature of message passing communication in Erlang it's a
perfect fit for a simulation environment for distributed agents.
Agents are represented as Erlang processes.
